## Week 1
**Dates**: [9/16-9/21]  
**Goals for the Week**:
- Started first draft of project proposal
- Meet with TA to dicuss design and get project aprooved

**Tasks Completed**:
- Created high level block diagram for design of project
- Made three high level requirements for the design
- Started first draft of project proposal
- Submit finished project proposal

**Challenges**:
- Understanding ultrasonic sensor's datasheet and how to integrate it in the project

**Next Steps**:
- Drill down design and finish first draft of project proposal

## Week 2
**Dates**: [9/23-9/28]  
**Goals for the Week**:
- Start Design Review 

**Tasks Completed**:
- Rough Draft of design review completed
- Started researching parts that we need to order

**Challenges**:
- Our project requires many systems that we have little experience with, so we needed to research a lot to figure out our design review

**Next Steps**:
- Finalize Design Review

## Week 3
**Dates**: [9/30-10/4]  
**Goals for the Week**:
- Meet with Mentor TA to finalize and correct project proposal
- Correct project proposal to reflect changes TA suggests
- Finish design review

**Tasks Completed**:
- Met with Mentor TA
- Created more specific subsystem requirments with detailed unit tests for each
- Created quantifiable high level design requirements
- Finished design review and added new subsystems
- Did more calcualtions to ensure our subsystems would cueed

**Challenges**:
- We needed to develop unit tests for high level software components when we haven't made them yet

**Next Steps**:
- Start order parts
- Set up AWS
- Begin PCB design

## Week 4
**Dates**: [10/7-10/12]  
**Goals for the Week**:
- Start order parts
- Set up AWS
- Begin PCB design

**Tasks Completed**:
-

**Challenges**:
- Finding sensors that fit within budget constraints.

**Next Steps**:
