## Week 1
**Dates**: [9/9-9/13]  
**Goals for the Week**:
- Identify high level design of the project
- Start first draft of project proposal
- Meet with Mentor TA

**Tasks Completed**:
- Met with Mentor TA
- Created high level block diagram for design of project
- Made three high level requirements for the design
- Started first draft of project proposal

**Challenges**:
- Understanding ultrasonic sensor's datasheet and how to integrate it in the project

**Next Steps**:
- Drill down design and finish first draft of project proposal

## Week 2
**Dates**: [9/16-9/20]  
**Goals for the Week**:
- Finalize all parts and design
- Submit finished project proposal

**Tasks Completed**:
- Finalized first draft of design
- Submitted project proposal

**Challenges**:
- Our project requires many systems that we have little or no experience with, so it was hard to create detailed diagrams and requirements for those unfamiliar systems. 

**Next Steps**:
- Meet with Mentor TA to finalize and correct project proposal

## Week 3
**Dates**: [9/23-9/27]  
**Goals for the Week**:
- Meet with Mentor TA to finalize and correct project proposal
- Correct project proposal to reflect changes TA suggests

**Tasks Completed**:
- Met with Mentor TA
- Created more specific subsystem requirments with detailed unit tests for each
- Created quantifiable high level design requirements

**Challenges**:
- Creating specific unit tests for high level software components when we haven't made them yet

**Next Steps**:
- Submit revised project proposal, work on design document

## Week 4
**Dates**: [9/30-10/4]  
**Goals for the Week**:
- Submit revised project proposal
- Finish and submit design document

**Tasks Completed**:
- completed

**Challenges**:
- Finding sensors that fit within budget constraints.
